In this section we will see how we can use NeatMS to create our own training dataset, we will discuss the different options offered to train the neural network model, and, finally, we will see how to tune the specificity/sensitivity of our model.

> Important: Note that the tool to manually label peaks has been developed specifically for Jupyter notebook. Launching the tool outside a notebook will fail.
