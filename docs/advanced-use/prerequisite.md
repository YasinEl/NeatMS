# Prerequisite

In this section we will see how we can use NeatMS to create our own training dataset, we will discuss the different options offered to train the neural network model, and, finally, we will see how to tune the specificity/sensitivity of our model.

As previously mentionned, you will need extra libraries to use the integrated labelling tool.

* jupyter notebook
* dash
* jupyter dash


You can install them through the pip command

`pip install notebook dash jupyter-dash`

> Important: Note that the tool to manually label peaks has been developed specifically for Jupyter notebook. Launching the tool outside a notebook will fail. Support for running the tool in jupyter lab and outside of the jupyter environment is under development.
