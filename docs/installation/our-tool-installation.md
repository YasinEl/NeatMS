# NeatMS installation

## Requirements

NeatMS requires python 3.6 or higher and a [TensorFlow compatible system](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#system-requirements). We also strongly recommend the use of a [vritual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). 

## Dependencies

These dependencies will be automatically installed with NeatMS package. However, we recommend to install them manually through pip and verify that they are installed and configured properly.

* pymzml
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* tensorflow
* pillow
* h5py
* keras
