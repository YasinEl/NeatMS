# Quick start guide

We strongly recommend to read the [Getting started](getting-started.md) section of this documentation to familariaze yourself with the tool. However, if you want to quickly test the tool, you can do so by following the basic usage tutorial available as a jupyter notebook on the github repository (TODO: link). 

You can install jupyter through pip using the following command:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

More information on how to install and run jupyter notebook is available [here](https://jupyter.org/install).
